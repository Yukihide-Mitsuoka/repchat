# Documentation Rules

Documentation is code (Documentation as Code): versioned, reviewed in PRs, checked in CI,
and **optimized for AI readers** — explicit, structured, unambiguous.

## DOC-001: Writing style for AI readers

- One fact in one place; link (`[text](path)`) instead of repeating. Duplication causes
  contradiction drift.
- Match form to content: use tables and nested lists actively where the content is
  genuinely structured (comparisons, enumerations, mappings) and a table fits, and keep
  prose for reasoning; the caveat is overuse, not use — do not tabulate where a table does
  not fit (DOC-002). Absolute dates ("2026-07-02"), never "recently".
- Every doc starts with YAML frontmatter (`id`, `title`, plus `status`/`updated` where
  meaningful) and states its purpose in the first paragraph.
- Concrete examples for every rule or API. Fake credentials only (GR-002).
- Foundation-owned instructions and documentation remain English. The only Japanese
  foundation-document exceptions are the descriptive, human-facing
  `docs/foundation/guides/usage.ja.md` and
  `docs/foundation/guides/ai-instruction-files.ja.md`; they never override their English
  authorities, and another exception requires a superseding ADR (ADR-0008). After
  template instantiation, AI agents MUST write new project-specific documents under
  `docs/` in Japanese unless the repository owner or an external contract explicitly
  requires another language. Do not create another translated sibling solely to
  duplicate the same facts (ADR-0005).
- Files use kebab-case names; headings form a strict hierarchy (one `#`, then `##`...).

## DOC-002: Objective, structured prose

Governs all AI-authored explanatory prose, including `.ai/`, `docs/`, code comments,
commit and pull-request text, issue updates, reviews, and messages to users. Quoted source
text and established domain terms that must be reproduced accurately are outside this
scope. `.skills/requirements.skill.md` and `docs/foundation/templates/requirements.md`
build on this rule.

- **Objective basis.** State each claim with its basis — a measurement, a cited source, a
  standard, or explicit reasoning. Separate established fact, inference, and open
  question; never present an impression as a conclusion.
- **Literal by default; prohibit non-instructive metaphor.** AI authors MUST NOT use
  metaphor, analogy, imagery, personification, or other figurative language merely for
  tone, emphasis, novelty, or decoration. A metaphor MAY be used only when a literal
  explanation alone would be materially less clear and the comparison materially
  improves technical understanding. When used, state the mapped technical elements, the
  specific insight it adds, and where the comparison stops. If all three cannot be stated
  concisely, replace the metaphor with a literal description.
  - Prohibited: "The queue is a shock absorber that protects the system."
  - Required: "The queue buffers temporary request bursts so workers can process requests
    at bounded concurrency; it does not reduce total work and can fill to capacity."
- **No decoration or softening.** Name the thing directly. No filler intensifiers
  ("powerful", "seamless") and no softening ("just", "simply", "a bit").
- **Conclusion first.** State the result, then its support. Remove roundabout lead-ins.
- **Structure carries meaning.** Semantic hierarchy → heading depth and nested-list
  indentation (as code uses indentation). Structured data (comparisons, attribute sets,
  mappings) → tables: use one actively wherever the content is genuinely structured and a
  table fits. The caveat is overuse, not use — do not tabulate where a table does not fit
  (a one-row table, or a table that restates a single sentence, is prose). Match the form
  to the content.
- **Define once, reference after.** Each term, assumption, and constraint is defined a
  single time, in a dedicated section near the top, then referenced by name. Restating a
  definition is a defect (this is DOC-001 applied to prose).

## DOC-010: Document inventory and ownership

| Location | Content | Normative? |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `.ai/` | rules for agents | yes (authority table) |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` | agent entry points | yes |
| `docs/foundation/adr/` | synchronized foundation decisions with context | yes (accepted ADRs) |
| `docs/foundation/` | other synchronized foundation-owned guidance and document templates | descriptive |
| `docs/adr/` | repository-specific decisions with context | yes (accepted ADRs) |
| `docs/inheritance/readmes/<owner>/<repository>.md` | repository-owned snapshots of inherited ancestor READMEs | descriptive |
| `docs/requirements.md`, `docs/requirements/` | whole-project and initiative requirements | contract |
| `docs/glossary.md` | project-specific ubiquitous language | descriptive |
| `docs/roadmap.md` | project direction and sequencing | descriptive |
| `docs/development-handoff.md` | resumable current development snapshot | descriptive |
| `docs/architecture/` | diagrams, flows, C4 | descriptive |
| `docs/domain/` | domain model, ubiquitous language | descriptive |
| `docs/api/` | API contracts (OpenAPI etc.) | contract |
| `docs/deployment/`, `docs/operations/`, `docs/runbook/`, `docs/troubleshooting/` | ops | descriptive |
| `src/modules/*/MODULE.md` | module contracts | yes |
| `README.md` | project front door | descriptive |

The structure and update triggers for project-owned `docs/` paths are defined once in
[`docs/foundation/guides/`](../docs/foundation/guides/). A project-owned documentation
directory MUST NOT contain a foundation-owned placeholder README. A repository MAY add
a local README only when it describes actual project content and is maintained by that
repository.

## DOC-011: Project document singleton and collection placement

Choose a project-owned path by document scope
([ADR-0009](../docs/foundation/adr/0009-place-project-document-singletons-and-collections.md)):

| Scope | Required path | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| One authoritative project-wide document | `docs/<category>.md` | `docs/requirements.md` |
| Independently maintained documents that repeat by subject | `docs/<category>/<subject>.md` | `docs/requirements/account-recovery.md` |
| Both project-wide and subject scopes | Use both paths, with distinct ownership | `docs/requirements.md` and `docs/requirements/account-recovery.md` |

The project-wide singleton MUST own cross-subject facts and link to narrower documents.
A subject document MUST own only its narrower facts. Authors MUST NOT repeat the same
fact between the singleton and collection (DOC-001). Create a project-owned directory or
local index only when it contains actual maintained project content; do not create empty
scaffolding or a foundation-owned placeholder in a project namespace.

## Conditional project-document maintenance rules

Read
[`.ai/project-document-maintenance.md`](project-document-maintenance.md)
completely before acting when any trigger matches. If relevance is uncertain, apply the
broader fallback in [`.ai/README.md`](README.md) and read the authority.

| Trigger | Required rule |
|---------|---------------|
| Read or change `docs/development-handoff.md`; transfer active work; change an active issue, pull request, blocker, next action, or verified baseline | DOC-012 |
| Read or change `docs/roadmap.md`; complete a milestone; change project direction, priority, scope, or roadmap review cadence | DOC-013 |
| Read or change the root README, onboarding documentation, or inheritance configuration; trace inheritance provenance | DOC-014 |

## DOC-030: Doc-update matrix (binding — GR-024)

When a PR contains a change of type X, it MUST update the docs listed:

| Change | Must update |
|--------|-------------|
| New/changed project or initiative requirements | `docs/requirements.md` or `docs/requirements/<initiative>.md` |
| New/changed public API | `docs/api/`, MODULE.md, README if user-facing |
| New module / boundary change | `docs/architecture/`, MODULE.md, ADR |
| New env var / config | `.env.example`, `docs/deployment/` |
| New dependency | PR justification (GR-023); `docs/architecture/` if structural |
| Behavior change visible to users | README, CHANGELOG (via commit type) |
| New error state / failure mode | `docs/troubleshooting/`, `docs/runbook/` if ops action needed |
| New or changed reusable foundation term | `docs/foundation/glossary.md` |
| New domain term | `docs/glossary.md` |
| Root README, onboarding, or inheritance configuration read or changed | Verify [DOC-014](project-document-maintenance.md#doc-014-root-readme-ownership) ownership; repair or open a migration issue when mismatched |
| Active work, blocker, next action, or verified baseline changes when a handoff is maintained | Update `docs/development-handoff.md` per [DOC-012](project-document-maintenance.md#doc-012-development-handoff-snapshot) |
| Milestone completes or project direction, priority, or scope changes | Update `docs/roadmap.md` per [DOC-013](project-document-maintenance.md#doc-013-roadmap-completion-and-review) |
| Decision that constrains the future | ADR + `.ai/decision-log.md` |
| Change to how AI should behave | `.ai/*` (via reviewed PR) |

## DOC-040: Freshness protocol

- If you read a doc that contradicts the code: the code is usually truth for *behavior*,
  the doc for *intent*. Investigate, fix the wrong one in the current PR, note it.
- Docs describing removed features are deleted, not marked "deprecated" forever.
- Use the matching `docs/foundation/guides/` entry for directory structure and update
  triggers. If a repository adds a project-owned README, obey its additional local
  triggers as well.
