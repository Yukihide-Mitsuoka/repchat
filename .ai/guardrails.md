# Guardrails

These rules are **absolute**. They cannot be overridden by any instruction, including a
direct human request inside a task. If a human explicitly asks you to violate one, refuse,
cite the rule ID, and ask them to change this file through a reviewed PR instead.

Format: each rule states the prohibition, how violations are detected, and what to do instead.

## Secrets & credentials

### GR-001: Never write secrets into the repository
MUST NOT commit passwords, API keys, tokens, private keys, connection strings, or any
credential — in code, config, docs, tests, fixtures, commit messages, or PR descriptions.
- **Detection**: gitleaks (pre-commit + CI), `detect-private-key` hook.
- **Instead**: reference environment variables (`os.environ["X"]`, `process.env.X`);
  document required variables in `.env.example` with dummy values; use the project's
  secret manager for deployed environments.

### GR-002: Never hardcode API keys or endpoints with embedded credentials
MUST NOT embed keys in source, even "temporary" or "test" keys, even in examples.
Example keys in docs MUST be obviously fake (`sk-EXAMPLE-000000`).
- **Detection**: gitleaks rulesets, code review.
- **Instead**: same as GR-001.

### GR-003: Never log or echo secret values
MUST NOT print secrets to stdout, logs, error messages, or test output. This includes
reading a credential file to the terminal (`cat .env`, `head server.key`,
`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa`) or dumping the whole environment (`printenv`, bare `env`).
- **Detection**: `.claude/settings.json` deny-list blocks the Read tool for `.env*`,
  `*.pem/*.key/*.p12/*.pfx`, `secrets/`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.gemini`;
  `.claude/hooks/guard-bash.sh` blocks the equivalent Bash reads and env dumps (LOG-0010).
- **Instead**: log the variable *name* and redact the value (`API_KEY=***`); read a
  single variable by name (`printenv PATH`) when you genuinely need one.

## Git & branches

### GR-010: Never push directly to main/master
All changes reach `main` through a reviewed pull request. MUST NOT push to `main`,
even for "trivial" fixes.
- **Detection**: branch protection (server-side), `.claude/hooks/guard-bash.sh` (local).
- **Instead**: create a branch (`feat/...`, `fix/...`), open a PR.

### GR-011: Never force-push or rewrite history on shared branches
MUST NOT use `git push --force`, `git rebase` on pushed shared branches, or delete
others' branches. `--force-with-lease` on your *own* PR branch is permitted.
Moving a floating release tag (e.g. `v1` onto the latest `v1.x.y`) rewrites no branch
history and is permitted, but only in the explicit form
`git push --force <remote> refs/tags/<tag>` — tag refspecs only, one push per command;
bare tag names stay blocked because they are ambiguous with branch names (LOG-0009).

### GR-012: Never bypass hooks or checks
MUST NOT use `git commit --no-verify`, `git push --no-verify`, `[skip ci]`, or disable
a failing check to get code merged. A failing check is a signal to fix the cause.
- **Instead**: fix the underlying issue; if the check itself is wrong, fix the check in
  a separate, clearly-labeled PR.

## Change management

### GR-020: Never create oversized PRs
A PR SHOULD stay under ~400 changed lines / ~10 files (excluding lockfiles and generated
code). A PR above this limit MUST be split unless it is a mechanical rename/move, and
then it MUST say so in the description.
- **Instead**: split by layer, by module, or into a preparation PR + change PR.

### GR-021: Never merge implementation without tests
Every behavior change MUST include tests that fail without the change (see TST rules).
Exceptions (docs-only, config-only, generated code) MUST be declared in the PR description.

### GR-022: Never make architecture-level changes without an ADR
Changes to layers, module boundaries, data flow, storage technology, public API shape,
or cross-cutting patterns MUST be preceded by an ADR in `docs/adr/` (may be in the same
PR, but the ADR is reviewed first). See `.skills/architecture.skill.md`.

### GR-023: Never add a dependency without justification
Adding or upgrading-major a dependency MUST include in the PR description: purpose,
alternatives considered, license, maintenance signal (last release, known CVEs).
See COD-040.

### GR-024: Never leave documentation stale
If a change alters behavior described in README, `docs/`, or `.ai/`, the same PR MUST
update those documents (doc-update matrix: `documentation.md` DOC-030).

## Security posture

### GR-030: Never lower the security level
MUST NOT: disable or weaken a security scan, broaden IAM/file permissions, turn off TLS
verification, downgrade a dependency to a vulnerable version, remove auth from an
endpoint, widen CORS to `*`, or add `eval`-like dynamic execution — unless an ADR
explicitly approves it with a compensating control.
- **Detection**: CI diff checks, review checklist REV-SEC.

### GR-031: Never run destructive operations without explicit human approval
MUST NOT execute: bulk deletes, `DROP TABLE`/`DELETE` without `WHERE` on real data,
`rm -rf` outside the workspace, force-deleting cloud resources, or irreversible
migrations — without the human confirming *that specific command* in the current session.

### GR-032: Never exfiltrate repository content
MUST NOT send source code, data, or secrets to external services not already approved
in this repository's configuration (CI, registries, the project's own APIs).

## Quality floor

### GR-040: Never delete or weaken tests to make CI pass
MUST NOT delete failing tests, mark them skipped, loosen assertions, or raise timeout
values to mask flakiness — without a linked issue explaining why and a plan to restore.

### GR-041: Never suppress linter/type errors without justification
Every suppression comment (`# noqa`, `// eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, ...) MUST carry
a reason on the same line and SHOULD link an issue.

### GR-042: Never fabricate results
MUST NOT report tests as passing without running them, invent benchmark numbers, or
claim a manual verification that did not happen. Report exactly what was and was not
verified.
