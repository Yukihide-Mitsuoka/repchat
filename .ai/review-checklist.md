# AI Review Checklist

Used for: reviewing PRs, and mandatory **self-review** before opening a PR (WF-001 §5).

## Protocol

1. Read the PR description and the linked issue first — review against *intent*, not
   just the diff.
2. Classify the change scope (ARC-020) and check the matching rules were followed.
3. Walk the checklist below. Skip sections that clearly don't apply, but say so.
4. Report findings ranked by severity: **Blocker** (guardrail/security/correctness) >
   **Major** (bug risk, missing tests) > **Minor** (quality) > **Nit** (style beyond
   linter — usually omit).
5. Every finding cites: file:line, the violated rule ID if any, and a concrete fix.
   Findings without an actionable fix are observations, not findings.
6. Verify claims by reading the code — never approve on the diff description alone
   (GR-042 applies to reviews too).

## Checklist by viewpoint

### REV-ARC: Architecture
- [ ] Dependency direction respected (ARC-002); no cross-module internal imports
- [ ] Change scope classified correctly; ADR present if architectural (GR-022)
- [ ] MODULE.md updated when the contract changed (ARC-003)
- [ ] No new abstraction without a current second consumer (COD-051)
- [ ] New/changed interfaces are deep (ARC-005): small surface, complexity hidden,
      passes the deletion test; no pass-through layers

### REV-MNT: Maintainability
- [ ] Code matches surrounding idioms (COD-050); naming per COD-002 and glossary
- [ ] Functions within size/nesting bounds (COD-003); no dead/commented-out code
- [ ] Duplication rule of three respected (COD-020)
- [ ] A future agent could understand this diff without this conversation's context

### REV-PRF: Performance
- [ ] No N+1 queries, no I/O inside loops, no unbounded result sets (pagination)
- [ ] Appropriate data structures; no accidental O(n²) on user-sized input
- [ ] Caching only with an invalidation story; measurements cited for perf claims (GR-042)

### REV-SEC: Security
- [ ] No secrets, no hardcoded keys (GR-001..003)
- [ ] Input validated at boundary; parameterized queries only (SEC-010)
- [ ] AuthN/AuthZ on every new endpoint (SEC-020); no security downgrade (GR-030)
- [ ] New dependencies justified, scanned, license-checked (GR-023, REL-030)
- [ ] No PII in logs (SEC-011)

### REV-A11Y: Accessibility (UI changes)
- [ ] Semantic elements; labels on inputs; keyboard operable; focus managed
- [ ] Contrast meets WCAG 2.2 AA; no information conveyed by color alone
- [ ] Alt text for images; announcements for async updates

### REV-SCL: Scalability
- [ ] Stateless where required (ARC-010); no local-file/in-memory state that breaks >1 instance
- [ ] Long work is async/queued, not blocking requests
- [ ] Data growth considered: indexes for new query patterns, archival for unbounded tables

### REV-REL: Reliability
- [ ] Failure paths handled (COD-010): timeouts on all external calls, retries only on
      idempotent operations, no infinite retry
- [ ] Migrations backward-compatible (REL-040); feature-flagged if risky
- [ ] Errors observable: structured logs at failure points, metrics for new critical paths

### REV-TST: Testing
- [ ] Tests exist and fail without the change (GR-021, TST-002)
- [ ] Error paths and boundaries tested, not just happy path
- [ ] Deterministic (TST-010); mocks only at ports (TST-020)
- [ ] Coverage did not decrease (TST-003); no weakened tests (GR-040)

### REV-DOC: Documentation
- [ ] Doc-update matrix satisfied (DOC-030); `.env.example` current
- [ ] PR description complete and honest; breaking changes marked (WF-020)
- [ ] New terms in glossary; ADR linked where required

### REV-DX: Developer & Agent Experience
- [ ] `make` targets still work; setup instructions still accurate
- [ ] Error messages actionable for the next developer/agent
- [ ] No increase in permission prompts / manual steps without justification
- [ ] New patterns documented so agents can imitate them (COD-050 stays possible)
