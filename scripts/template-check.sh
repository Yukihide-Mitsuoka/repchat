# Template self-check ("make doctor"): fast, dependency-free validation that the
# foundation's own metadata invariants hold. Automates what a manual/agent audit would
# otherwise catch. Exits non-zero on any violation. Add checks here as invariants grow.
#
# Currently verifies:
#   1. Every .ai/*.md and .skills/*.skill.md begins with a valid YAML frontmatter block
#      (`---` ... `---`) — the metadata the routing/authority system depends on.
#   2. No file carries the "collapsed frontmatter" signature a non-frontmatter-aware
#      formatter produces (guards against the LOG-0007 regression recurring).
#   3. Foundation regression tests, including governance and document-language policy.
#   4. Child repositories with a manifest satisfy the local inheritance and legacy
#      Template Sync protection contract.
#   5. Foundation-owned project-documentation guides do not occupy project-owned paths.
#   6. Declared AI context routes remain bounded without omitting mandatory authorities.
#   7. Downstream required Make targets do not retain template no-op implementations.
#   8. Root README ownership is valid when marked; legacy missing markers remain warnings.
