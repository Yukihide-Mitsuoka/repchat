# Executor Module

Purpose: compile the tenant boundary **into** a SQL query at the AST level and run it
(ADR-0005 原則C-2). It is the application-layer half of hard tenant isolation — the half
that must hold even before the datasource-layer backstop (per-tenant dataset / RLS,
LOG-0032) is reached. It does NOT own authorization decisions (the gate does), report
definitions, or NL→SQL generation.

## Public API (the contract — everything else in this module is private)

| Entry point | Layer | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `bindQuery(sql, binding, policy)` | domain | Validate a query and rewrite it so every physical table is bound to the tenant's dataset and every row-scoped table is wrapped in its scope filter. Returns `BoundQuery` or a typed `Rejection` |
| `assertRowScopeBound(sql, scope, policy)` | domain | Check that SQL binds the row scope at every use of a row-scoped table. `bindQuery` runs it on its own output; exported because the invariant holds for any SQL, and proving it *rejects* needs input no correct binder produces. Returns `null` when bound, a `Rejection` otherwise |
| `ExecuteQuery.execute(tenantId, sql, params, scope)` | application | Resolve the tenant's dataset, bind the SQL (boundary + caller-supplied row scope), run it, audit what actually ran. Refusals never reach the runner |
| `ports.ts` interfaces | application | What adapters must implement (`QueryRunner`, `BindingResolver`, `AuditSink`, `QueryCatalog`); `TenantDataset` is the ① boundary fact |
| `createExecutorHandler(deps)` | interface | Inbound HTTP (`POST /v1/query`) for the production topology. Authenticates the calling gate with a shared secret before trusting the tenantId/scope it asserts |

## Events

| Direction | Event | Schema | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| publishes | `query.execute` | `AuditSink` port | on success; carries the **bound** SQL and the tables touched |
| publishes | `query.refused` | `AuditSink` port | on a binder rejection, with the rejection code |
| publishes | `query.failed` | `AuditSink` port | on a runner error; the driver message stays audit-side |

## Owned data

None. The module holds no store; it transforms SQL and (once the execute use case lands)
reads the tenant's analytics dataset.

## Invariants (MUST always hold — each maps to a test)

1. Every physical table in the output is qualified to the caller's own dataset — across
   joins, CTE bodies, FROM-subqueries, WHERE-subqueries, scalar subqueries, UNION
   branches and comma joins.
2. A caller-supplied dataset qualifier (`other.orders`) is refused, never honoured.
3. Only tables on the policy allowlist are reachable; an unlisted table is refused no
   matter how deeply it is nested.
4. Only a single `SELECT` is accepted — DML, DDL and stacked statements are refused.
5. Row scope is applied at **every occurrence** of a scoped table, and an empty scope
   filters to nothing (`IN (NULL)`) rather than degrading to no filter.
6. After rewriting, the output is re-parsed and every base table verified to be bound to
   the caller's dataset; a walker gap therefore yields `rewrite-failed`, never a leak.
7. Identifiers and scope values emitted into SQL text are charset-validated; anything
   else is refused.
8. A table whose policy entry leaves `scopeColumn` undeclared is refused
   (`policy-incomplete`), never treated as unscoped. `null` is how a dimension declares
   "not row-scoped" out loud — an omission would be indistinguishable from forgetting,
   and forgetting returns every row (ADR-0010 D6).
9. After rewriting, the output is re-parsed a second time and every row-scoped table
   verified to sit inside **this principal's** scope filter — the same column, the same
   store set. Symmetric to invariant 6, and load-bearing in a way 6 is not: unlike the
   tenant boundary, the row scope has no data-layer backstop behind it
   (ADR-0010, LOG-0040). Exposed as `assertRowScopeBound` so the rejection path is
   testable with SQL no correct binder would produce.
8. Nothing reaches the `QueryRunner` that has not been through `bindQuery` — a refusal
   short-circuits before execution.
9. The dataset is resolved from a server-supplied `tenantId`; a resolver returning a
   dataset for a different tenant is refused rather than followed. The ① tenant boundary
   is never accepted from the caller.
10. The ② row scope IS supplied by the caller (the authorization layer that derived it
    from roles, 原則E②) and is a required argument — it can never default open. This
    keeps a single source of truth for scope, so the ② cache key and the SQL filter
    cannot disagree.
11. Query parameters are passed to the runner as parameters, never interpolated into the
    SQL text.
12. The query runs as the tenant's own connection principal (ADR-0010 D1): the
    `QueryIdentity` (`projectId` + `credentialRef`) is resolved server-side from `tenantId`
    in `TenantDataset` and never accepted from the caller, exactly like the dataset. Both
    identity fields are required — an omission is a compile error, not a silent fall-back
    to a shared credential. A `credentialRef` the `AdcTokenProvider` cannot serve is
    refused rather than run under the runtime's own identity. (The impersonating provider
    and the live source-side backstop proof land in the follow-up PR; this PR is the seam,
    behavior-preserving with `credentialRef: null`.)
12. An audit-sink failure never fails an otherwise successful query, and never masks a
    refusal.
13. The BigQuery runner never returns a partial answer as if it were complete: an
    incomplete job or a paged result is an error, not truncated rows.
14. The HTTP interface refuses an unauthenticated caller before binding anything, and
    compares the service secret in constant time. A malformed or missing scope is a 400 —
    it never coerces to all-rows.

## Dependencies

| Uses module | Via | Why |
|-------------|-----|-----|
| (none) | — | Adapters shipped: BigQuery `QueryRunner` (REST `jobs.query` + ADC) and in-memory (tests, ARC-005 second adapter). Pending: wiring into `gate`'s `QueryExecutor` port (#55). `BindingResolver` is served by the control-plane module once it exists |

External: `node-sql-parser` (Apache-2.0) for BigQuery-dialect parse/serialize — see the
COD-040 justification in the PR that introduced it.
