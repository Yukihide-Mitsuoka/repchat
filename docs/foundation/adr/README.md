# Foundation Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Immutable records of decisions owned by `ai-dev-foundation` and synchronized to
downstream repositories. Project-specific decisions belong in `docs/adr/`. Both use the
process in `.skills/architecture.skill.md`.

## Rules

- Numbered sequentially: `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`. Copy the
  [foundation ADR template](../templates/adr.md).
- Status flow: `proposed → accepted | rejected`; later `deprecated` or
  `superseded by ADR-NNNN`. **Accepted ADRs are never edited** — supersede them.
- One decision per ADR. Keep it under ~2 pages.
- The ADR PR is approved by a human before implementation starts (GR-022).
- Every ADR gets a line in [.ai/decision-log.md](../../../.ai/decision-log.md).

## Index

Use the Scope column for bounded discovery. Read every matching ADR completely and
broaden the search under ADR-0012 when relevance is uncertain.
